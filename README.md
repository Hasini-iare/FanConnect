# FanConnect

FanConnect is a lightweight web app that brings sports teams and their fans closer. It includes team updates, live polls, a canvas-based chart, and a simple dashboard — all built in one HTML file using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
Latest team updates and match schedules
Interactive fan polls with real-time simulated updates
Vertical bar chart drawn on canvas with per-option colors and legends
Automatic “live update” simulator with timestamps
Simulator pauses when the tab isn’t active
Light/dark theme toggle
Fully responsive layout

## How It Works
Everything runs locally inside a single HTML file. JavaScript handles poll data, chart rendering, simulated updates, and theme switching. The UI adjusts smoothly across devices.

## Challenges
Keeping all functionality in one file
Redrawing the canvas on every update
Handling tab-visibility to pause updates
Making the UI readable in both themes

## Conclusion
FanConnect is a simple but interactive example of real-time polling, responsive design, and custom chart rendering using only vanilla web technologies.
